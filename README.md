# SF Raytracer Example
This raytracer is meant to be user-friendly while using many features of SF to help people progress independently. The code itself is straightforward, but, uses a few shortcuts. 

Current features
* Custom skybox rendering
* Simple drawing on background colors
* mixing and coloring props with their color and light color
* Simple reflections
* Configurable FOV, qouta, and render scale

Future features
* Custom tracer to trace the vismesh of props (Currently only renders physmeshs of props)
* Real texture rendering/High definition texture replacement (Props currently do not show textures, only their color and light; map only returns simple color)
* Infinite reflections
* Info/Dev features to view information realtime with layers
* Independance from render.getSurfaceColor
  
*Screenshots were all rendered with 120 FOV and 1:1 render scale*
